# AI Contribution Guidelines

1. You will be assigned a task on a dedicated `git worktree`.
2. Perform your task ONLY within the directories you own per `.github/CODEOWNERS`.
3. Before committing, ALWAYS run `pnpm format` and `pnpm lint:fix`.
4. Commit your changes with a conventional commit message (e.g., "feat(ui): create ConceptCard component").
5. After your work is done, report a summary back to the `@graphiti` agent.
